# Step 6: Build your own app
## Project Start
Now, head over to `Tab3.tsx` to start building. Use components like `CardWrapper.tsx` for neat info cards or `CarouselWrapper.tsx` for a slideshow.
## Customization Tips
Remember, you can change the text, colors, and even sizes of most components. Make your app truly yours.
## Design Creativity
Feel free to experiment. The best apps come from trying new things. What if your app had a theme, like underwater or outer space?
