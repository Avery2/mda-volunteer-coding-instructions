**Lesson Plan: Creating Your Own Webpage**

Today, you're going to become a web developer! 🌐 You'll learn how to create a webpage that can do some pretty cool things, like showing videos and pictures from your favorite social media, sharing information in a fun way, and keeping track of exciting events!

## What We'll Build

Imagine you're in charge of creating a webpage for your school's basketball team 🏀, your science club's next big event 🧪, or even your own virtual pet show! What would that look like? Well, you're about to find out!

### Features of Your Webpage:

1. **Media Display**: Show off awesome dunks, science experiments, or cute pets with videos and photos from Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube.
2. **Accordion Component**: This is a fancy way of saying "a section that can expand and collapse" – perfect for FAQs, game schedules, or pet care tips.
3. **Calendar & Events**: Keep everyone updated on practice times, club meetings, or the pet show lineup.

## Navigation Guide

In our online coding environment, you'll find three tabs in the file structure: src/tabs/Tab1.tsx for tutorials, src/tabs/Tab2.tsx for examples, and src/tabs/Tab3.tsx for your own creation. You can edit the code directly and see the results instantly!
