# Step 1: Introduction to Components

## Introduction to Components
Components are like building blocks of an app. Each has a specific function, like showing a calendar or a button you can click.
## Component List
- "AccordionWrapper.tsx: Creates a collapsible list, perfect for FAQs."
- "ButtonWrapper.tsx: Adds buttons that can do things when clicked."
- "CalendarWrapper.tsx: Displays a calendar for events."
- "And many more like CardWrapper, CarouselWrapper, GiphyWrapper, etc."
## App Structure
Our app has three main sections, each in a separate tab. You'll start with learning in Tab1, see examples in Tab2, and create your own app in Tab3.
