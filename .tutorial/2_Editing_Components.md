# Step 2: Editing Components

## Selecting a Component
In `Tab1.tsx`, you can select a component to edit. For example, to work with the Button, open `ButtonWrapper.tsx`.
## Code Snippets
Each component has a code snippet. For the Button, it might look like `<ButtonWrapper text="[TODO: Button Text]" onClick="[TODO: Action]"/>`.
## Try It Yourself
Change the `[TODO: Button Text]` to something fun like 'Click Me!' and see what happens when you view the app.
