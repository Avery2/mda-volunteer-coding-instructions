# Step 2: Editing Components

## Selecting a Component
In `Tab1.tsx`, you can select a component to edit. For example, to work with the Button, open `ButtonWrapper.tsx`.
## Code Snippets
Each component has a code snippet. For the Button, it might look like `<ButtonWrapper text="[TODO: Button Text]" onClick="[TODO: Action]"/>`.
## Try It Yourself
Change the `[TODO: Button Text]` to something fun like 'Click Me!' and see what happens when you view the app.


## Integration
You can show posts from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube using `InstagramWrapper.tsx`, `TikTokWrapper.tsx`, and `YouTubeWrapper.tsx`.
## Parameters
To display a video, replace `[TODO: Video URL]` with the link to the video you want to show.
## Creative Use
Think of a theme for your app and choose videos or images that match. For example, if your app is about space, find cool space videos.
