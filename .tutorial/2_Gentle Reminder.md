# A Gentle Reminder

As we move through the steps, remember that moving at your own pace is okay. Feel free to experiment and try different things. If you ever get stuck or want to start over, here's how you can reset:

- **Reset Button**: You can always go back to the template link and create a new Replit! Just click this link: [https://replit.com/@timyiu/test?v=1](https://replit.com/@timyiu/test?v=1)
	- TODO: make sure this link is up to date
- **Copy-Paste Magic**: You can also copy the initial code from the tutorial and paste it back into the editor to reset your progress. For each of the coding sections, you'll see this at the bottom of the page.
