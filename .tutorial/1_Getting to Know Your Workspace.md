# Meet Your Workspace

When you log in, you'll see different areas on your screen. This is your workspace! Here's a quick tour:

- **Code Editor**: Where you'll write your code. It's like the command center for your webpage.
- **Preview Area**: See your webpage come to life in real-time as you code!
- **Component Library**: A treasure chest of features you can add to your webpage, like images, videos, and calendars.

**Try It Yourself**: Find the 'Giphy' component in the library, drag it into your workspace, and paste a fun GIF link into it!

## Navigation Guide

In our online coding environment, you'll find three tabs in the file structure: src/tabs/Tab1.tsx for tutorials, src/tabs/Tab2.tsx for examples, and src/tabs/Tab3.tsx for your creation. You can edit the code directly and see the results instantly!
