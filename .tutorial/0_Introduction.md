## Lesson Plan: Creating Your Webpage

Today, we're diving into the exciting world of web development! You'll learn how to create your webpage using cool components like media displays, information accordions, and event calendars. Think of your webpage as your digital canvas, where you can bring your ideas to life.

## What We'll Build

Imagine you're in charge of creating a webpage for your school's basketball team 🏀, your science club's next big event 🧪, or even your virtual pet show! What would that look like? Well, you're about to find out!

## What You'll Learn:

- Basic concepts of websites and how they work.
- Introduction to web languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- How to navigate and use the online coding environment.

## Features of Your Webpage:

1. **Media Display**: Show off awesome dunks, science experiments, or cute pets with videos and photos from Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube.
2. **Accordion Component**: This is a fancy way of saying "a section that can expand and collapse" – perfect for FAQs, game schedules, or pet care tips.
3. **Calendar & Events**: Update everyone on practice times, club meetings, and the pet show lineup.
## Before We Start:

- Make sure you're logged into the online environment.
- Have an idea of what you'd like your webpage to be about. It could be anything from your favorite sports team, a school project, or an upcoming event you're excited about!

## Navigation Guide

In our online coding environment, you'll find three tabs in the file structure: src/tabs/Tab1.tsx for tutorials, src/tabs/Tab2.tsx for examples, and src/tabs/Tab3.tsx for your creation. You can edit the code directly and see the results instantly!
