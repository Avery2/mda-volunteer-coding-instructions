# Step 5; Brainstorm Session
## Inspiration
Think about what you're passionate about. Is it sports, music, science? Your app can reflect that.
## Sketching
Instead of drawing on paper, you can create a digital sketch of your app's layout using a `.draw` file. Here's how:

1. **Create a New `.draw` File**: In the online coding environment, find the option to create a new file. Name your file with a `.draw` extension, like `myAppSketch.draw`.

2. **Open the `.draw` File**: Once created, open your `.draw` file. You should see a blank canvas or a drawing interface.

3. **Use Drawing Tools**: Utilize the drawing tools provided in the environment. You can draw rectangles to represent components like calendars or social media feeds, add text to label each part, and use lines to connect components showing the flow of your app.

4. **Design Your Layout**: Place each component where you think it should go on your app's screen. For example, you might draw a large rectangle at the top for a carousel of images, a smaller square below for a calendar, and a few more rectangles for social media feeds.

5. **Save Your Sketch**: Make sure to save your `.draw` file once you're satisfied with your sketch. This will be your digital blueprint as you build your app in the creation tab (`Tab3.tsx`).

Creating a `.draw` file for your sketch allows you to easily modify your layout as your ideas evolve and keeps a digital record of your planning process.
