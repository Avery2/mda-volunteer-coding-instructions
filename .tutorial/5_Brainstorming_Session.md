# Step 5; Brainstorm Session
## Inspiration
Think about what you're passionate about. Is it sports, music, science? Your app can reflect that.
## Sketching
Instead of drawing on paper, you can create a digital sketch of your app's layout using a `.draw` file. Here's how:

1. **Create a New `.draw` File**: In the online coding environment, find the option to create a new file. Name your file with a `.draw` extension, like `myAppSketch.draw`.

2. **Open the `.draw` File**: Once created, open your `.draw` file. You should see a blank canvas or a drawing interface.

3. **Use Drawing Tools**: Use the drawing tools provided in the environment. You can draw rectangles to represent components like calendars or social media feeds, add text to label each part, and use lines to connect components and show the flow of your app.

4. **Design Your Layout**: Place each component on your app's screen where you think it should go. For example, you might draw a large rectangle at the top for a carousel of images, a smaller square below a calendar, and a few more rectangles for social media feeds.

5. **Save Your Sketch**: Save your `.draw` file once you are satisfied with your sketch. As you build your app in the creation tab (Tab3.tsx), this will be your digital blueprint.

Creating a `.draw` file for your sketch allows you to easily modify your layout as your ideas evolve and keep a digital record of your planning process.

### Envisioning with Purpose

As you prepare to sketch your app's blueprint, consider the components we've explored together:

- **AccordianWrapper.tsx** for unfolding stories or information
- **ButtonWrapper.tsx** to engage and interact
- **CalendarWrapper.tsx** to highlight key dates
- **CardWrapper.tsx** for a touch of elegance and summary
- **CarouselWrapper.tsx** to showcase a series of images or content
- **GiphyWrapper.tsx**, **InstagramWrapper.tsx**, **TikTokWrapper.tsx**, **YouTubeWrapper.tsx** for dynamic media
- **ImageWrapper.tsx** for static visual moments
- **TabsWrapper.tsx** to organize content neatly

And let's not forget the humble `<p></p>`, your canvas for words, where text weaves together the narrative of your app.

### Sketch with Intention

As you embark on your digital sketch for `Tab3.tsx`, wield these components as your tools. Imagine how each can serve your theme and enhance the user experience. For instance, might a `CarouselWrapper.tsx` at the top celebrate last season's highs for a sports app? Could `AccordianWrapper.tsx` unveil the chapters of an unfolding science project?

Remember, each component you've witnessed in Tabs 1 and 2 are the building blocks you'll use in Tab 3. Remember to use them!
