# Step 3: Create Your Accordion

## Purpose
The Calendar component (`CalendarWrapper.tsx`) shows events. It's great for keeping track of important dates.
## Customization
Try editing the calendar by adding an event. Find the code snippet and change `[TODO: Event Name]`, `[TODO: Date]`, and `[TODO: Description]`.
## Experimentation
Add your own event, like your birthday or a holiday, and see it appear on the calendar.
