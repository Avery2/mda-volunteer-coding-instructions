# Step 1: Introduction to Components

## Introduction to Components
Components are like building blocks of an app. Each has a specific function, like showing a calendar or a button you can click.
## Component List
- "AccordionWrapper.tsx: Creates a collapsible list, perfect for FAQs."
- "ButtonWrapper.tsx: Adds buttons that can do things when clicked."
- "CalendarWrapper.tsx: Displays a calendar for events."
- "And many more like CardWrapper, CarouselWrapper, GiphyWrapper, etc."
## App Structure
Our app has three main sections, each in a separate tab. You'll start with learning in Tab1, see examples in Tab2, and create your own app in Tab3.

In our online coding environment, you'll find three tabs in the file structure: src/tabs/Tab1.tsx for tutorials, src/tabs/Tab2.tsx for examples, and src/tabs/Tab3.tsx for your creation. You can edit the code directly and see the results instantly!

# Step 3: Create Your Accordion

## Purpose
The Calendar component (`CalendarWrapper.tsx`) shows events. It's great for keeping track of important dates.
## Customization
Try editing the calendar by adding an event. Find the code snippet and change `[TODO: Event Name]`, `[TODO: Date]`, and `[TODO: Description]`.
## Experimentation
Add your own event, like your birthday or a holiday, and see it appear on the calendar.
