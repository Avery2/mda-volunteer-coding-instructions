# Step 1: Introduction to Components

## Introduction to Components
Components are like building blocks of an app. Each has a specific function, like showing a calendar or a button you can click.
## Component List
- "AccordionWrapper.tsx: Creates a collapsible list, perfect for FAQs."
- "ButtonWrapper.tsx: Adds buttons that can do things when clicked."
- "CalendarWrapper.tsx: Displays a calendar for events."
- "And many more like CardWrapper, CarouselWrapper, GiphyWrapper, etc."
## App Structure
Our app has three main sections, each in a separate tab. You'll start with learning in Tab1, see examples in Tab2, and create your own app in Tab3.

# Step 3: Create Your Accordion

## Purpose
The Calendar component (`CalendarWrapper.tsx`) shows events. It's great for keeping track of important dates.
## Customization
Try editing the calendar by adding an event. Find the code snippet and change `[TODO: Event Name]`, `[TODO: Date]`, and `[TODO: Description]`.
## Experimentation
Add your own event, like your birthday or a holiday, and see it appear on the calendar.
