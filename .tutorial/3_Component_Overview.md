# Step 1: Introduction to Components

## Navigation

In the following section we'll be going over the files that you can see in this section of your environment:

## Understanding the App Structure

Our application is organized into three main sections, conveniently separated into tabs to streamline your learning journey:

- Tab 1 (src/tabs/Tab1.tsx): This is your classroom, where tutorials and guides come to life.
- Tab 2 (src/tabs/Tab2.tsx): A showcase of examples to inspire and illustrate what's possible.
- Tab 3 (src/tabs/Tab3.tsx): Your canvas, where you'll craft your very own application.

You can edit the code directly and see the results instantly! Switch between these tabs to learn, observe, and then apply your newfound knowledge. It's a cycle of learning that empowers you to build with confidence.

## Introduction to Components
Components are like building blocks of an app. Each has a specific function, like showing a calendar or a button you can click.

But don't let their functionality intimidate you; at their core, components are simply text files that transform code into interactive elements on your webpage. For example, the `CalenderWrapper.tsx` is what defines the Calendar you see at the top of Tab 1!

## Next Steps

Here's a glimpse of the components at your disposal:

- AccordianWrapper.tsx
- ButtonWrapper.tsx
- CalendarWrapper.tsx
- CardWrapper.tsx
- CarouselWrapper.tsx
- GiphyWrapper.tsx
- ImageWrapper.tsx
- InstagramWrapper.tsx
- TabsWrapper.tsx
- TikTokWrapper.tsx
- YouTubeWrapper.tsx

This array of components might seem daunting at first glance, but remember, you're not expected to master them all at once. Our approach is to introduce you to patterns common to these components, simplifying the learning process. You're free to select the ones that best fit your project, and we're here to guide you through using them effectively.

# Step 2: Editing Components

## Selecting a Component
In `Tab1.tsx`, you can select a component to edit. For example, to work with the Button, open `ButtonWrapper.tsx`.
## Code Snippets
Each component has a code snippet. For the Button, it might look like `<ButtonWrapper text="[TODO: Button Text]" onClick="[TODO: Action]"/>`.
## Try It Yourself
Change the `[TODO: Button Text]` to something fun like 'Click Me!' and see what happens when you view the app.


## Integration
You can show posts from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube using `InstagramWrapper.tsx`, `TikTokWrapper.tsx`, and `YouTubeWrapper.tsx`.
## Parameters
To display a video, replace `[TODO: Video URL]` with the link to the video you want to show.
## Creative Use
Think of a theme for your app and choose videos or images that match. For example, if your app is about space, find cool space videos.

**Try It Yourself**: Find the 'Giphy' component in the library, drag it into your workspace, and paste a fun GIF link into it!
