## Navigation

In the following section we'll be going over the files that you can see in this section of your environment:

## App Structure
Our app has three main sections, each in a separate tab. You'll start with learning in Tab1, see examples in Tab2, and create your own app in Tab3.

In our online coding environment, you'll find three tabs in the file structure: src/tabs/Tab1.tsx for tutorials, src/tabs/Tab2.tsx for examples, and src/tabs/Tab3.tsx for your creation. You can edit the code directly and see the results instantly!

## Introduction to Components
Components are like building blocks of an app. Each has a specific function, like showing a calendar or a button you can click.

A component is just a text file behind the hood! When your app is up and running, you'll be able to see it on your webpage. For example, the `CalenderWrapper.tsx` is what defines the Calendar you see at the top of Tab 1!
